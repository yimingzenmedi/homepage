# homepage
homemade homepage : )

Navigation website implemented by vue. This contains ~~version 1.0~~ (home.html) and version 1.1 (index.html). All the background pictures are from [wallpapercave](https://wallpapercave.com/). Version 1.1 is recommanded. The following introduction is also based on v1.1.

## Functions

### 1. Search
Provide 3 search engines: **Google**, **Bing** and **Baidu**. The search engine can be changed by *clicking on the search engine icon in front of the search box.* The first time open this page, the default search engine is **Google**. The selected search engine will be stored in **Local Storage**, and later everytime open this page, the search engine stored will be loaded. 

Of course, *enter the content you want to query in the input box* , *click the search icon* on the right or *hit enter* to search.


### 2. Shortcut
Shortcuts are *hidden* and *displayed when the mouse is over it*. There are 11 pre-stored shortcuts: **Youtube**, **Bilibili**, **Gmail**, **Google docs**, **Github**, **JD.com**, **TradeMe**, **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **Instagram** and **QQ mail**. You can add your own shortcuts site by *clicking the **+** button*, but *the background image of the custom shortcut can only be the icon for this website* (I wanted to use the default icon of the linked website but the effect is not so good because the icons of most websites are small and in low resolution). All the shortcuts can be removed by *clicking the red **x*** at the right top of the tags. 

The information of shortcuts will also be storaged in **Local Storage** so the next time you enter this website the shortcuts will be loaded.


### 3. Others
+The background images will be randomly changed every time you open this page or refresh it. 
+The color of the breathing lights on both sides of the main area is randomly generated.
+The placeholder content of the search box is randomly selected from the presets.
+There are 2 hidden buttons (not really hard to find :P ).

## What's next

For the next step I want to write a backend and a login program to allow users to synchronize settings and stored shortcuts via logging in.

More features are being imagined...

***Enjoy your journey with it!***
